Born and raised in the Central West of NSW in a small town named Cowra.  
When I got my HSC, I moved to Canberra and studied Accounting. 
I decided I did not like Accounting and continued to work in the Aquatics industry for 4 years, then went onto to work in the television 
industry for 4.5 years. While working on computers in the television industry, I decided to study IT online. 
</p><p>I have been brought up in the age of console and PC gaming and I keep this hobby today. 
For the last two years I’ve openly expressed my hobby by starting a gaming podcast with two friends, called Draw Distance. 
We have 24 episodes published and counting!</font>

I was born in January 1990 and I can honestly say my interests in IT have evolved significantly over that course of time, 
starting from our first DOS computer in 1993, where we played games such as Space Invaders and Leisure Suit Larry, 
to Windows 95 and dialup internet, where my brother and I messed around with Winamp and figured out how to make mix tapes by connecting 
the stereo to the computer.</p><p>I’ve experienced the rise of file sharing networks, online gaming networks and social media, 
add that to the rise of smartphones, well... these technologies have dominated my entire life, so how can I not be interested in IT?
 There would not be a specific point where my interest started because we had a DOS computer when I was three years old, 
 and you can bet I was instantly trying to figure it out, and see what I could do with it.

  In 2015, I entered the television Industry by working as a Presentation Coordinator,
  this meant I would be on computers working with a piece of software called, Harris Client. 
  In Harris, we would ingest our commercials and play them out in a listing format while also taking network feeds so we 
  could fit the commercials between whatever was playing, where it be live sport or current affair programs. 
  During this time, I significantly upgraded my PC hardware and started messing around in UNITY, following tutorials from YouTube.
  I am interested in game design, the dawn of AI, podcasting, any software that changes the way we do things.
  I have especially been following Tesla and their self-driving capabilities/advancements. 
  This personally, has me excited.</p><p> After a while, I decided it was time I studied what I was passionate about, and that is many things IT. 
  I wanted to keep working and study part time, so I turned to Open Universities. 
  The RMIT course seemed a natural fit for what I am after. 
  I want to explore in depth some key areas like AI and data analysis, hopefully this will shape where I go into the industry.

  Database Administrator
So, what is a Database Administrator and what do they do?
A Database Admin considers an organizations data needs and uses specialized software to manage database systems. This role involves configuration, installation, database customization, migration, backup, and data recovery.  Today, most organisations  
over the past five years, I have considered myself to be skilled in data analysis, I enjoy looking at the finer details and picking out the important elements. In my previous role in television, the fine details mattered in running a smooth operation. All commercials require precise key numbers which are pulled from servers. Everything runs to exact timing down to the last frame, so cue triggers mattered, as well as bug offset timing.
</p><p>According to seek.com, there are few ways to achieve this job. Complete a Cert IV in Digital Media Technologies, a Diploma of Database Design and Development or a bachelor’s degree in information technology. I am currently studying the latter, so that would be my way forward. It is also recommended to join the Australian Computer Society (ACS). To attain membership, you need to be studying IT, then graduate to achieve full certification. The ACS certification also requires what is called, Continuing Professional Development (CDP).
Database Administrator requires 1-5 years’ experience in the fields of Data Analysis or as a Database Developer. I may need to intern with a company within these fields while I study online to really get a leg up.

  According to the Myers-Briggs test, my four main characteristics are Extraverted, Sensing, thinking, and perceiving or ESTP. 
  I think this means I am more of a social learner; I try to keep things grounded and logical. 
  One characteristic is “resourceful and adaptable”, I tend to agree with this, I am quite flexible in a team, 
  but I do not usually gravitate to the leadership position.</p><p>
  I am a visual learner, so it may be important that this is communicated to my team, 
  that I will be using graphics often to convey information in my work.  
  I took a verbal reasoning test; this shows that I carefully consider options to an answer and 
  come to a conclusion based on the all the relevant information that is at hand.

  Thermal sensor for temperature screenings.
The idea is to build a simple thermal scanner that reads peoples temperatures as they walk into a public place such as a retail store or movie cinema. This will offer many businesses a low cost way to provide temperature screenings for patrons/customers in the current pandemic climate. 
To keep it low cost we will be using a Raspberry Pi4 and an Adafuit IR Thermal camera, which is approximately $150.00 in cost. To interpret the data, Python code will be used and run on the Raspberry Pi.
